# fineroots_finecode

Welcome to the project repository for my master's thesis: Fine-rooted problems: the effect of fine root senescence on mycorrhizal nutrient transfer in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda).

The objective of the project is to explore nutrient transfer between loblolly pine seedlings through mycorrhizal networks in the event of experimentally induced fine root senescence. This involves isotopically labeling "donor" seedlings through foliar application or stem infiltration. "Donor" and "recipient" seedlings, those not isotopically labeled, were defoliated at varying levels (0, 50%, 75% and 100%) to induce fine root death. Following defoliation, seedlings were harvested in four separate tissue groups (needles, stem, lowroots and highroots) and sent off for isotopic analysis.

The structure of the code-base for this project is R. The data can be found in the data folder in the fineroots_finecode repositroy. The data are in a .csv format and should be read in as such. The data contains plant numbers, the isotope labeling treatment, if the seedlings was designated as a donor or recipient, tissue type, and APE (atomic percent enrichment) values.

##The structure of the code-base is R. The data can be found in the data folder within this MP_Algae_Project repository. The data should be read in as a comma seperated value file. The data contains: sampling date, sampling site, location within site, depth, chlorophyll-a concentration, turbidity, phycoyanin concentration, microplastic abundance, total dissolved nitrogen, and phycocyanin to chlorophyll-a ratio.

##My results can be relpicated by using boxplot and occasionally ggplot to illustrate the relationship between different variables. I typically use linear models, with an assumed normal distribution.

I would like to thank Dr. Seth Pritchard for being an amazing thesis advisor and fearless leader into the wild world of fine root and mycorrhizal biology. I appreciate the many hours Hastings Marek and Brasil Cumberbatch dedicated to helping me in the greenhouse and am thankful for the statistical mentorship of Dr. Dan McGlinn.
