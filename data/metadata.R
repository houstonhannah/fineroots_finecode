#metadata for mock_foliar, mock_free_planting, and mock_stem

#plant_num: the individual number assigned to each seedling
  
#isotope_label: the way in which isotopic labels were applied to the seedlings; foliar or stem.
  #foliar application: an aqueous solution of 13C and 15N2 was painted onto the needles of seedlings
  #stem infiltration labeling: a hole was drilled into the stems of seedlings and a cotton wick was run through the hole. The wick was placed in a reservoir containing a 13C and 15N2 solution 
  
#treatment: refers to the level of defoliation applied to the seedling to trigger a root death event
  #no_defol: seedlings were not defoliated 
  #con_no_defol: seedlings were not defoliated, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections
  #0.5_donor_defol: 50% of the needles were removed from donor seedlings
  #0.5_recip_defol: 50% of the needles were removed from recipient seedlings
  #con_0.5_donor_defol: 50% of the needles were removed from donor seedlings, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections
  #con_0.5_recip_defol: 50% of the needles were removed from recipient seedlings, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections
  #0.75_donor_defol: 75% of the needles were removed from donor seedlings
  #0.75_recip_defol: 75% of the needles were removed from recipient seedlings
  #con_0.75_donor_defol:75% of the needles were removed from donor seedlings, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections
  #con_0.75_recip_defol: 75% of the needles were removed from recipient seedlings, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections
  #1.0_donor_defol: 100% of the needles were removed from donor seedlings
  #1.0_recip_defol: 100% of the needles were removed from recipient seedlings
  #con_1.0_donor_defol: 100% of the needles were removed from donor seedlings, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections
  #con_1.0_recip_defol: 100% of the needles were removed from recipient seedlings, cores were rotated to sever mycorrhizal connections

#donor_or_recipient: donor seedlings were isotopically labeled, recipient seedlings were not isotopically labeled
  #d: donor seedlings
  #r: recipient seedings
  
#tissue: when harvested, seedlings tissues were separated into four different tissue groups for analysis
  #needles: the needles from the seedling
  #stem: the stem of the seedling
  #lowroot: 1st - 3rd order roots from the seedlings
  #highroot: 4th - highest order roots from the seedlings
  
#APE: Atomic Percent Enrichment of samples (15N2 and 13C) from IRMS analysis of plant tissues
